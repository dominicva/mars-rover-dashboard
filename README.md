# Mars Rover Dashboard

### Big Picture

- SPA that consumes the NASA API

- Allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view.

- Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to view a gallery of recent images taken by that rover, as well as some additional information about the rover and its mission.

- I have used this project as an opportunity to practice various functional JS techniques.

### Run on your local machine

1. Get the code
2. Run <npm install>
3. Run <npm start> to start local express server at port 3000
